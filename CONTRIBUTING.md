# Contributing to rtMedia
We love your input! We want to make contributing to rtMedia as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Closing policy for issues
Github issue-tracker is used **only** for developer & contributor discussion.
For support-request/feature-request, please use - https://rtmedia.io/support/

## Our Development Process
We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Flow
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `pre-release`.
2. Ensure your code doesn't give any errors. Run make before creating the pull request.
3. Add a proper description about the fix.
4. Add reference of the issue in the description.
5. If you've added code that should be tested.
6. Make sure to follow [WordPress coding standards](https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress-Coding-Standards).
7. Issue that pull request!

Please include your wordpress.org username while sending a pull-request so that we can add you to the contributor's list.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/rtmediawp/rtmedia/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes/Screenshots (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
- Please include your wordpress.org username so that we can add you to the contributor's list.

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.
